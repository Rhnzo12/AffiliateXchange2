Auto-generation Requirements:
●When creator approved (7 minutes after application), system automatically generates:
○Unique tracking link per creator-offer pair

Payment Flow:

9. AUTOMATED WORKFLOWS
Creator Application Auto-Approval
Trigger: Creator submits application Workflow:
1.Store application with status "Pending"
2.Send immediate confirmation email/push notification
3.Wait 7 minutes
4.Change status to "Approved"
5.Generate unique tracking link:
○Create short code (8 characters, alphanumeric)
○Format: https://track.yourapp.com/go/{shortCode}
○Store in database with application_id reference
6.Send approval notification with tracking link
7.Log event in analytics
Example Videos Per Offer Enforcement
Validation Rule: Companies must upload between 6-12 example videos before offer can be submitted for approval Implementation:
●Upload interface shows count: "6 of 12 videos uploaded"
●Submit button disabled until minimum (6) reached
●Warning message if trying to submit with <6 videos
●Confirmation prompt if exactly 6 videos (suggest adding more)
Payment Processing Automation
Trigger: Company approves creator's work completion Workflow:
1.Calculate amounts:
○Gross amount (agreed commission)
○Platform fee (4% of gross)
○Processing fee (3% of gross)
○Net amount (gross - 7%)
2.Schedule payment based on company's payment terms
3.On scheduled date:
○Charge company via stored payment method
○If charge successful: Initiate payout to creator
○If charge fails: Retry 3 times over 3 days, then notify admin
4.Send confirmation emails to both parties
5.Update transaction records
Priority Listing Expiration
Rule: Priority listings last 30 days unless renewed Workflow:
●7 days before expiration: Email company with renewal option
●On expiration: Remove priority badge, return to normal listing
●Log event in company account

10. ANALYTICS IMPLEMENTATION
Tracking Infrastructure
Central Tracking System:
●Single GA4 property owned by platform
●Use Measurement Protocol API for server-side tracking
●Track events:
○offer_view - Offer page viewed
○offer_apply - Application submitted
○link_click - Affiliate link clicked
○conversion - Sale/lead/goal completed (if trackable)
○video_view - Example video played
○favorite_add - Offer saved
○message_sent - Message sent between users
○review_submit - Review submitted
Custom Tracking Links:
●Format: https://track.yourapp.com/go/{shortCode}
●On click:
○Log click event (timestamp, IP, user agent, referrer, geo)
○Check if unique click (based on IP + user agent + 24h window)
○Update click counts in database
○Send event to GA4 via Measurement Protocol
○Redirect to final destination URL
●Conversion tracking:
○Option 1: Postback URL (company pings when conversion happens)
○Option 2: Pixel tracking (embed tracking pixel on thank you page)
○Option 3: Manual confirmation (company marks conversions in dashboard)
Alternative to GA4
Recommended: Segment.io or Mixpanel
●Easier implementation than GA4 Measurement Protocol
●Better UI for non-technical users
●Built-in dashboards
●Real-time data
●Easier to debug
●Can still forward events to GA4 if needed
Implementation:
1.Integrate Segment/Mixpanel SDK in backend
2.Track same events as listed above
3.Create standard dashboards for creators and companies
4.Use Segment's personas for user attribution
5.Set up automated reports
